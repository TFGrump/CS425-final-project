## About the Game
Text based RPG adventure game in a procedurally generated, persistent, dynamic
world. Procedurally generated quests and events leave a lasting impact on the world
depending on their outcome. These will happen with or without player intervention.
The game is open-ended, but players would be encouraged to level up to explore the
higher difficulty areas of the game and ultimately exert more influence on the world
they inhabit. Death is permanent but the world is persistent. Your next character can
inhabit the same world as the old one.   

The game engine used was Java (we made one from scratch and included what we needed for our game to work) and is played using the terminal.    

Provided there is sufficient diversity in quest and world generation, our game will
function as a sandbox where a player can experience adventures and dynamic stories
in a world where outcomes truly matter.
## Techique Used
We used Perlin noise in order to scale the difficultly of the people across the map. We did this so we had a smooth transition between high and low level enemies, we basically did not want a high level enemy being right next to a low level enemy.
